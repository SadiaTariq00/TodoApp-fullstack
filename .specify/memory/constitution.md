# Hackathon II – Todo Full-Stack Web Application Constitution

## 1. Development Law (Strict Enforcement)

- The project **MUST** follow the **Agentic Dev Stack**:
  1. Write specification
  2. Generate implementation plan
  3. Break into tasks
  4. Implement using Claude Code only

- **Human-written code is strictly forbidden**
- All code must be generated by **Claude Code**
- Judges will review:
  - Prompts
  - Specs
  - Plans
  - Iterations
- Skipping or merging steps is prohibited

## 2. Spec Authority Rules

- Every feature **MUST originate from a written specification**
- Specs:
  - Written in Markdown
  - Stored inside `/specs`
  - Follow Spec-Kit Plus structure
- Specs are the **single source of truth**
- No implementation is allowed without an approved spec
- All implementation prompts must reference specs using:
  `@specs/path/to/file.md`

## 3. Locked Technology Stack (No Substitutions)

### Frontend
- Next.js **16+** (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS

### Backend
- Python **FastAPI**
- SQLModel ORM

### Database
- Neon **Serverless PostgreSQL**

### Authentication
- Better Auth (Next.js frontend)
- JWT tokens shared with FastAPI backend

### Spec System
- Spec-Kit Plus
- Claude Code CLI

## 4. Application Scope (Phase II Only)

Allowed features:
- Task CRUD operations
- Task completion toggle
- Multi-user support
- RESTful API
- JWT-secured authentication

Each task must include:
- id
- user_id
- title
- description
- completed
- created_at
- updated_at

❌ Disallowed:
- AI features
- Chatbot
- File uploads
- Role-based access
- Notifications

## 5. REST API & Security Law

- All APIs must live under `/api`
- All endpoints require:
  `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>`
- Backend **MUST**:
  - Verify JWT signature
  - Extract authenticated user
  - Enforce task ownership
- Accessing another user's task is forbidden
- Missing or invalid token → `401 Unauthorized`

## 6. Mandatory Monorepo Structure

## 7. Agent Governance

All work must be done by agents

Humans may only:
- Write prompts
- Review outputs

Agents must operate within assigned roles
No agent may exceed its authority
Agents must obey:
Constitution → Specs → Plans → Tasks

## 8. Documentation Law

README.md must describe:
- Project purpose
- Stack
- How to run

CLAUDE.md must exist:
- Root
- Frontend
- Backend

Constitution overrides all documentation

## 9. Quality & Validation

Code must be:
- Spec-compliant
- Modular
- Minimal
- Secure

Any deviation from this Constitution:
→ Phase II is invalidated
